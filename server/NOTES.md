## Features

- User can like things or ask for more posts like it. Unlike normal reddit, they can get more posts on demand.
- Users can say what they don't like.

## TODO

- Add Sqlite DB to have persistence over the users history as well as AI generated posts, comments, etc. This will also create the subs that are generated by the AI or user suggested.
- Add concise 'persona' information to each users response so that when the user interacts they get a consistent experience.
