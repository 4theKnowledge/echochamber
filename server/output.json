        "body": "Produced from 1971-1986, the Datsun 1200 Ute has evolved from a basic utility vehicle to a beloved classic in the car community. Its lightweight body and rear-wheel drive layout made it unexpectedly fun to drive, with some enthusiasts swapping in more powerful engines for a real sleeper experience. Yet, outside its cult following, it's often overlooked. Is the Datsun 1200 Ute an underrated icon or just nostalgia on wheels? What's your take on this classic piece of automotive history?",

This sudden change is sensed by pain receptors, which send a message to your brain via the trigeminal nerve (responsible for facial sensation).
